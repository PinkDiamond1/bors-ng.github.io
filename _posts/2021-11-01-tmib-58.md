we landed 15 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [OnceCell](https://docs.rs/once_cell/), a tiny Rust library that provides shared, late-initialized data types:

* It will never panic at runtime, unlike the standard library [RefCell](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html).
* It provides direct access to the stored data, unlike the standard library [Cell](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/cell/struct.Cell.html).
* It is on track to be [added to the standard library](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74465).
