### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [rust-sgx](https://github.com/fortanix/rust-sgx), Rust bindings to the Fortanix platform for developing in Intel SGX enclaves. The secure enclave is a feature of Intel processors where apps can run without anyone else on the system, even the operating system, being able to look inside or interfere with it, and others can prove that (provided nobody manages to rip the enclave apart; it's a tamper-resistent coprocessor).
