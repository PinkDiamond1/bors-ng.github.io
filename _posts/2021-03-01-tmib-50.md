It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, a GitHub app for projects where [nobody has access to master](https://beyermatthias.de/blog/2020/03/20/my-problem-with-the-nixos-community/).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20closed%3A2021-02-01..2021-02-28),
we landed 14 PRs in the bors-ng repository.
