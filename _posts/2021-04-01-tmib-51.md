It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, [a GitHub bot/app/whatever-you-want-to-call-it that orchestrates the batching, testing, and merging of PRs in such a way that nobody has access to push to the main branch](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/bors).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2021-03-01..2021-03-31),
we landed 17 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB].
If you find a mistake, pull requests or issue reports are appreciated!
