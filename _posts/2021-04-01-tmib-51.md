It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, [a GitHub bot/app/whatever-you-want-to-call-it that orchestrates the batching, testing, and merging of PRs in such a way that nobody has access to push to the main branch](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/bors).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2021-03-01..2021-03-31),
we landed 17 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB].
If you find a mistake, pull requests or issue reports are appreciated!

### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [podman-py](https://github.com/containers/podman-py), bindings to the podman/libpod API.

Podman is an OCI-complaint container runtime. It manager containers (lightweight virtual machines), images (images are to containers what executable files are to processes), volumes (which provide persistent storage for containers), and pods (groups of containers that run on the same computer and share volumes and network connections). Podman-Py provides a function API that connects to a running podman instance, for custom container orchestration workloads.
