### Who's using bors?

This month's featured user is [VersionVigilante.jl](https://github.com/bcbi/VersionVigilante.jl), a Julia CI tool for enforcing the rule that all pull requests must increase the version number in your project's `Project.toml` file. There's [instructions](https://github.com/bcbi/VersionVigilante.jl/blob/master/instructions_bors.md) on how to use it with bors, too!
