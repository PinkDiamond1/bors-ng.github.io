It's another monthly burst of news about bors-ng, [a GitHub application/bot that you put in charge of merging your PRs into the main branch](https://www.fluvio.io/blog/2021/05/bors-confident-merges/).

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2021-05-01..2021-05-31),
we landed 14 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

"This Month in Bors" is written [in public on GitHub][GitHub for TMiB].
If you find a mistake, pull requests or issue reports are appreciated!
